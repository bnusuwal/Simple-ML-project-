# Forest Fire Risk Prediction System for Nepal

## 🌍 Overview

This project presents a complete system for analyzing climate patterns and predicting forest fire risks across different regions of Nepal. It combines data processing, machine learning, and interactive visualizations into a user-friendly web application. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making and environmental monitoring in Nepal's vulnerable regions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📥 **Data Collection**: Gather and process climate and fire-related datasets
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Explore trends, correlations, and historical patterns
- 🤖 **Predictive Modeling**: Build ML models to forecast fire risk levels
- 🗺️ **Visualization**: Display results using interactive charts and maps
- 🌐 **Deployment**: Make the system accessible through a web app

## 👤 Target Users

- Data science learners seeking real-world applications
- Environmental researchers and analysts
- Policy makers and local authorities
- Anyone interested in Nepal's climate and forest fire challenges
