# Climate Change Impact Assessment and Prediction System for Nepal

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis and ML-based prediction system for forest fire occurrences in Nepal, with a special focus on vulnerable regions.It is developed as part of the Omdena-NIC Nepal Classroom Group B Capstone Project, which equips participants with foundational and advanced skills in AI and data science to address real-world climate challenges.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Data Collection**:Gather relevant forest fire and climate datasets from diverse Nepali sources.
- **Data Analysis**:Perform exploratory and statistical analysis to understand fire patterns and climate correlations.
- **Predictive Modeling**:Develop machine learning models to predict forest fire occurrences and risk scores.
- **Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards to visualize data and model predictions.
- **Deployment**: Develop a user-friendly web application for stakeholders to interact with the system.

## 👥 Target Audience

- Aspiring and recent data science graduates aiming to apply their skills to real-world climate challenges.
- Government agencies, NGOs, and research bodies working on climate resilience and forest management in Nepal.
- Local communities and decision-makers in vulnerable regions.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Includes source code for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `app.py/`: Contains code for the Streamlit web application.
- `.github/`: GitHub-specific files and workflows.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
